# üß† AI Memory System

This directory contains the "brain" files that power the AI orchestrator's decision-making and memory system. These files are **not documentation** - they are the cognitive system that allows the AI to understand project state, track progress, and make intelligent development decisions.

## üìÅ Memory Files

### Core Intelligence
- **`brain.md`** - Long-term project memory and architectural understanding
- **`instructions.md`** - Daily loop instructions that guide AI behavior
- **`prd.md`** - Product requirements and project vision

### Task Management
- **`task_log.json`** - Current, completed, and pending development tasks
- **`progress.md`** - Daily changelog of what the AI has accomplished

### Learning System
- **`topics.md`** - Topics covered in the learning system (prevents duplication)

### Project Context
- **`project_synopsis.md`** - High-level project overview and guidelines

## üîÑ How It Works

The AI orchestrator (`ai_committer/main.py`) reads these files every day to:
1. Understand the current project state
2. Decide what to work on next
3. Execute development tasks
4. Update memory files with progress
5. Commit and push changes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- These files are **actively modified** by the AI orchestrator
- Do not manually edit during automated runs
- Changes here directly affect AI decision-making
- This is the "consciousness" of the self-building system
